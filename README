This script simplifies opening of related files in Django projects.

If you are editing a file in a Django application, say "myproject/myapp", vim_django will find your settings.py, get the template directory, and return <template_directory>/<myapp>.

This is particularly useful in combination with the Command-T plugin: vimscript #3025

Suggested mapping:
map <Leader>dt :VimDjangoCommandTTemplate<CR>

If you put that line in your .vimrc, hitting "<Leader>dt" while working on a Django application will start CommandT in the template directory corresponding to the application. ("<Leader>" is usually mapped as "\" or "," so try "\dt" or ",dt".)
